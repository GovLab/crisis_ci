                    Development at Harvard Kennedy School</h6>

                </p>
                <p>Matt Andrews' research focuses on public sector reform, particularly budgeting and financial
                    management reform, and participatory governance in developing and transitional governments. Recent
                    articles focus on forging a theoretical understanding of the nontechnical factors influencing
                    success in reform processes. Specific emphasis lies on the informal institutional context of reform,
                    as well as leadership structures within government-wide networks. This research developed out of his
                    work in the provincial government of Kwa-Zulu Natal in South Africa and more recently from his
                    tenure as a Public Sector Specialist working in the Europe and Central Asia Region of the World
                    Bank. He brings this experience to courses on public management and development. He holds a BCom
                    (Hons) degree from the University of Natal, Durban (South Africa), an MSc from the University of
                    London, and a PhD in Public Administration from the Maxwell School, Syracuse University. Read more
