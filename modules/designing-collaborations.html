                <h2>About the series</h2>
                <p>Now more than ever, governments, civil society, companies, and communities are being called upon to find new ways of working together to tackle the problems facing our world. But the uncertainties and anxieties surrounding COVID-19 have compounded the inherent challenges of cross-sector collaboration. 
                </p>
                <p>To support those working to build and lead transformative collaborations, Reboot is offering a three-part masterclass on: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>How to identify and engage the right collaborators, and set efforts up for success</li>
                    <li>How to align on a common agenda, and manage differing interests and priorities</li>
                    <li>How to drive a diverse group towards action, including managing tensions and disagreements</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We are excited to share our approaches and practical, time-tested tips on how to create strong, effective coalitions—including actors that may be historical opponents—to tackle urgent problems together.</p>
