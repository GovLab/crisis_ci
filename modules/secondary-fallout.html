        <h1>Secondary Fall-Out</h1>
        <a id="inst-link" href="../instructors.html#azby">By Azby Brown</a>
        <p>Many COVID-19 initiatives are rightly focussed on what we can consider the first order effects of the
            pandemic, namely health. This includes identifying and taking care of the ill, making sure medical supplies
            and personnel are available where they are needed. Issues like maintaining the many lifelines that people
            depend on day to day, such as food, housing, and communication, taking care of waste collection, and keeping
            utilities operating are often included in disaster response plans as second-order effects. There are others
            however, which are less concerned with logistics but with psychological and community damage. These often
            seem less like emergencies, but are often very serious and longer-lasting. As we develop and deploy
            solutions, it’s important to keep these second and third order effects in mind as well.</p>
