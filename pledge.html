       <h1>The Open COVID Pledge</h1>

        <p><b>April 7, 2020</b></p>
        
        <p>Immediate action is required to halt the COVID-19 Pandemic and treat those it has affected. It is a practical and moral imperative that every tool we have at our disposal be applied to develop and deploy technologies on a massive scale without impediment.
        <br><br>
        We therefore pledge to make our intellectual property available free of charge for use in ending the COVID-19 pandemic and minimizing the impact of the disease.
        <br><br>
        We will implement this pledge through a license that details the terms and conditions under which our intellectual property is made available.
        <br><br>
